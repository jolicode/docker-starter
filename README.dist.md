# My project

## Running the application locally

### Requirements

A Docker environment is provided and requires you to have these tools available:

 * Docker
 * Bash
 * [Castor](https://github.com/jolicode/castor#installation)

#### Castor

Once `castor` is installed, in order to improve your usage of `castor` scripts, you
can install console autocompletion script.

If you are using bash:

```bash
castor completion | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/castor
```

If you are using something else, please refer to your shell documentation. You
may need to use `castor completion > /to/somewhere`.

`castor` supports completion for `bash`, `zsh` & `fish` shells.

### Docker environment

The Docker infrastructure provides a web stack with:
 - NGINX
 - PostgreSQL
 - PHP
 - Traefik
 - A container with some tooling:
   - Composer
   - Node
   - Yarn / NPM

### Domain configuration (first time only)

Before running the application for the first time, ensure your domain names
point the IP of your Docker daemon by editing your `/etc/hosts` file.

This IP is probably `127.0.0.1` unless you run Docker in a special VM (like docker-machine for example).

> [!NOTE]
> The router binds port 80 and 443, that's why it will work with `127.0.0.1`

```
echo '127.0.0.1 <your hostnames>' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

### Starting the stack

Launch the stack by running this command:

```bash
castor start
```

> [!NOTE]
> the first start of the stack should take a few minutes.

The site is now accessible at the hostnames you have configured over HTTPS
(you may need to accept self-signed SSL certificate if you do not have `mkcert`
installed on your computer - see below).

### SSL certificates

HTTPS is supported out of the box. SSL certificates are not versioned and will
be generated the first time you start the infrastructure (`castor start`) or if
you run `castor docker:generate-certificates`.

If you have `mkcert` installed on your computer, it will be used to generate
locally trusted certificates. See [`mkcert` documentation](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation)
to understand how to install it. Do not forget to install CA root from `mkcert`
by running `mkcert -install`.

If you don't have `mkcert`, then self-signed certificates will instead be
generated with `openssl`. You can configure [infrastructure/docker/services/router/openssl.cnf](infrastructure/docker/services/router/openssl.cnf)
to tweak certificates.

You can run `castor docker:generate-certificates --force` to recreate new certificates
if some were already generated. Remember to restart the infrastructure to make
use of the new certificates with `castor build && castor up` or `castor start`.

### Builder

Having some composer, yarn or other modifications to make on the project?
Start the builder which will give you access to a container with all these
tools available:

```bash
castor builder
```

### Other tasks

Checkout `castor` to have the list of available tasks.
